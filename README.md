# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on the student performance dataset (`student-mat.csv`). It includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations to explore relationships between study time, gender, and final grades. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Download the dataset:**  
   Please download the `student-mat.csv` file separately from the source and save it on your Desktop (or a preferred folder).

2. **Adjust file path in the notebook:**  
   Before running the analysis, update the file path in the notebook to reflect your local path. If saved on the Desktop, the path might look like:  
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\student-mat.csv", sep=';')

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual system username.

## Project Structure
- `student_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis including loading, cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data.
- `student-mat.csv`: Dataset (not included, to be downloaded separately).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and handling missing/duplicate values.
- Statistical analysis and correlation.
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Interpretation of data insights for academic performance.

## Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook in an environment with Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn installed. Adjust file paths as noted in setup instructions.
